This project is designed to be both informative and aesthetically pleasing, encouraging more individuals and businesses to adopt solar energy solutions.
### Instructions to Run the Solar Energy Solutions Webpage Project

#### 1. **Project File Structure**
Ensure your project folder contains the following files:
```
/project-folder
    ├── index.html      (Main HTML file)
    ├── style3.css      (CSS file for styling)
    ├── scriptt.js      (JavaScript file for interactions)
    ├── /images         (Optional folder for local images)
```

#### 2. **Step-by-Step Setup**
1. **Download and organize the files**: Place the `index.html`, `style3.css`, and `scriptt.js` files into the project folder as shown above.

2. **Linking CSS and JavaScript**: 
   - In your `index.html` file (formerly `phr.html`), ensure the CSS and JavaScript files are linked correctly. The CSS link should be in the `<head>` section:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style3.css">
     ```
   - The JavaScript file should be linked just before the closing `</body>` tag:
     ```html
     <script src="scriptt.js"></script>
     ```

3. **Running the Project Locally**:
   - **Open `index.html`**: Navigate to your project folder and open `index.html` in any web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
   - The webpage will load, displaying the solar energy information along with interactive features such as FAQ toggle buttons and form submission validation.

4. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - **FAQ Toggle**: Clicking on any FAQ question will show or hide its answer.
   - **Form Validation**: When you fill out the "Get in Touch" form and click **Submit**, the form will check that all fields are filled. If any field is empty, a warning will be displayed.

#### 3. **Optional: Using a Local Server**
If you want to run the project on a local development server:
   - Use tools like **VS Code with Live Server Extension** or **XAMPP** to start a local server.
   - This is particularly useful if you want to test advanced JavaScript or server-side features.

#### 4. **Customizing the Project**:
- **Edit HTML Content**: You can modify text and images directly in `index.html`.
- **Adjust Styles**: Use `style3.css` to update colors, fonts, or layouts.
- **Extend JavaScript**: Add more interactions or enhance the form and FAQ behavior using `scriptt.js`.
